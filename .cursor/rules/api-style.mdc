Use best practices for express API and follow all recomendations in @docs/code-style



Use express for backend apis. 

They should follow restful standards when applicable 

The basic folder structure should be 

use shared models when applicable from /libs/models
```
    src/
        controllers/
            # one controller per resource ex (GET|PUT|POST|DELETE api/products) should contain operations on that 
            # should do request validation. delegate to a specific validator if logic is complex
            # do not implement buisness logic here; delegate to a service 
        routes/
            # entrypoints or available URIs. 
            # one route file per resource and includes all HTTP verbs. 
            # should delegate logic to controllers
        services/
            # buisness logic class
            # does not directly interact with an external depenency. that is delegated to a repository
        repository/
            # data access layer 
            # interface with DB or other external dependency
    assets/
        # contains images or fake data to be used 
        
    main.ts # minimal logic


```
